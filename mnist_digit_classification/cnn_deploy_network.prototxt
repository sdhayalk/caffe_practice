# defining the first conv layer, with name conv1
#	it is of type Convolution, taking bottom data and giving top conv1(itself)
# 	convolution params are 3x3 filter with 32 output channels, stride 1, using xavier initialization for weights and constant initialization for bias i.e. 0 (important)
# 	there are two param { }. lr_mults are the learning rate adjustments for the layerâ€™s learnable parameters. In this case, we will set the weight learning rate to be the same as the learning rate given by the solver during runtime, and the bias learning rate to be twice as large as that - this usually leads to better convergence rates.
