"EuclideanLoss": for predicting continuous values (regression tasks)
"SigmoidCrossEntropyLoss": for predicting binary outputs
"SoftmaxWithLoss" or "InfogainLoss": for predicting discrete labels

2) 
Do not convert multi-class discrete labels into one hot vector. Leave it as it is. Caffe will take care of it.
If you convert into one hot vector, it will give error if you have 'Accuracy' layer.
